* Installation :

    - Installing on Linux :
        
        If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you’re on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf:
        
        $ sudo dnf install git-all

        If you’re on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try apt:

        $ sudo apt install git-all

    - Installing on macOS :

        $ git --version

        If you don’t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

        If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at https://git-scm.com/download/mac.
    
    - Installing on Windows :

        There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to https://git-scm.com/download/win and the download will start automatically. Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to https://gitforwindows.org.

        To get an automated installation you can use the Git Chocolatey package. Note that the Chocolatey package is community maintained.
